# Actual Size resource pack
Have you ever broken a block in Minecraft, looked at the puny floating cubes and thought "we need to go bigger?" This resource pack rescales block item models such that they would be their actual size (i.e. 1 meter cubed) .

## Support
Supports [Consistency](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/consistency) (but not [Inconsistency](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/inconsistency) or [Consistency-Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/consistency-forge) ... yet) for Actual Sizeâ„¢ doors, armor stands (I hear they are Turing-complete), boats, etc.

## Issues
Issues should be reported on Github.

## Installation
Downloads can be found on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/actual-size)

## Other notes
Any claims made in the documentations (i.e. Semantic Versioning adherance) cannot be guranteed. I can only do so much okay?
